# FrootNinja
My game is actually called RootNinja because you slice root vegetables.

To play, hold and drag your mouse across roots to get points. Don't slice bombs or you'll lose points. If you don't slice fast enough, the root won't break. You can get combo points if you slice multiple root vegetables consecutively and quickly. If you don't slice a root, you will lose a life. You have 3 lives.

The gamescreen should be resizeable.
